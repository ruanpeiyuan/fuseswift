Swiftfuse is a FUSE application which provides access to openstack's swift 
using filesystem API.

Swift has been open-sourced as part of the OpenStack project.

BUILDING:

    You'll need libcurl, fuse, libssl, and libxml2 (and probably their dev
    packages) installed to build it.  From a base Debian or Ubuntu install,
    this should get you to a point you can build and run it:
        apt-get install build-essential libcurl4-openssl-dev libxml2-dev \
             libssl-dev libfuse-dev

    For CentOS or similar,
        yum install gcc make fuse-devel curl-devel libxml2-devel openssl-devel

    swiftfuse is built and installed like any other autoconf configured code.
    Normally,
        ./configure
        make
        sudo make install

USE:

    Your Rackspace Cloud username and API key can be placed in a file
    named $HOME/.swiftfuse:
        username=[Account username]
        api_key=[API key (or password for Keystone API)]

    The following settings are optional:
        authurl=[Authentication url - connect to non-Rackspace Swift]
        tenant=[Tenant for authentication with Keystone, enables Auth 2.0 API]
        password=[Alias for api_key, if using Keystone API]
        use_snet=[True to use Rackspace ServiceNet for connections]
        cache_timeout=[Seconds for directory caching, default 600]
        verify_ssl=[False to disable SSL cert verification]

    These can also be specified as mount options on the command line:
        swiftfuse --conf=/path/to/swiftfuse.conf mountpoint/

    It also inherits a number of command-line arguments and mount options from
    the Fuse framework.  The "-h" argument should provide a summary.


EXAMPLE:

    A typical .swiftfuse configuration file for use with OpenStack Essex:
        username=youraccount:yourusername
        api_key=yourkey
        authurl=http://127.0.0.1:8080/auth/v1.0
        cache_timeout=600
        debug=0

BUGS/SHORTCOMINGS:

    * rename() doesn't work on directories (and probably never will).
    * The root directory can only contain directories, as these are mapped to
      containers in swift.
    * Directory entries are created as empty files with the content-type
      "application/directory".
    * Cloud Files limits container and object listings to 10,000 items.
      swiftfuse won't list more than that many files in a single directory.
